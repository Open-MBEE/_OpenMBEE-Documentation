TWC has a different ID scheme than TWS. When MD projects are uploaded to TWC MS, changes all IDs embedded in text objects,
including mms IDs. As a consequence VE will not be able to resolve those cross references.
Before uploading a Crushinator TWS project to TWC  run the python scripts in this directory on the while MD project to make the IDs
MMS/VE conform.
